# Recipe Collection

The Recipe Collection Application is a comprehensive platform that allows users to create, store, and manage their recipes seamlessly. Built with Spring Boot for the backend and React.js for the frontend, this application combines robust security measures with an intuitive user interface.

Users can create accounts, log in securely, and take advantage of the Spring Boot security and authentication features. Upon logging in, they can upload recipes, complete with detailed ingredients, measurements, instructions, and accompanying photos. All saved recipes and associated media are securely stored within their accounts for easy access and management.
